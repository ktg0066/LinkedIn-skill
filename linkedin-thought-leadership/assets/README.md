# Personal LinkedIn Assets

This folder contains YOUR personalized content, frameworks, and insights that make this skill uniquely valuable to you.

## How Assets Are Used

When you ask Claude to create content, it will:
1. Check your PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS in SKILL.md
2. Reference relevant assets from these folders
3. Blend your authentic voice/examples with LinkedIn best practices
4. Generate content that sounds like YOU, optimized for the algorithm

## Folder Structure

### `/examples/`
Store your best-performing posts for pattern analysis. Claude will study these to understand what works for YOUR audience and replicate those patterns in new content.

### `/templates/`
Your custom post templates. When you develop a structure that works consistently, save it here so Claude can apply it to new content.

### `/frameworks/`
Your proprietary frameworks, models, and methodologies. When creating content, Claude will reference YOUR frameworks instead of generic ones.

### `/case-studies/`
Real examples from your work. Claude uses these for credibility and specificity instead of making up generic scenarios.

### `/research/`
Industry research, data, and trends specific to your domain. Helps Claude create data-driven posts with current, relevant information.

### `/voice-samples/`
Examples of your authentic writing from various contexts. Claude analyzes these to match your natural voice and style.

### `/audience-insights/`
Your analytics, demographics, and engagement patterns. Claude uses this to optimize content for YOUR specific audience, not generic best practices.

### `/competitors/`
Analysis of peers and influencers in your space. Helps identify content gaps and opportunities for differentiation.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly (5 minutes)
- Add your best post from the week to `/examples/`
- Update posting time insights in `/audience-insights/engagement-patterns.md`

### Monthly (15 minutes)
- Analyze patterns in `/examples/` and document learnings
- Update demographics in `/audience-insights/` based on LinkedIn analytics
- Add any new frameworks developed to `/frameworks/`

### Quarterly (30 minutes)
- Refresh industry data in `/research/`
- Update competitor analysis in `/competitors/`
- Review and refine voice samples in `/voice-samples/`

## Priority Hierarchy

If there's a conflict between:
- Generic best practices (in `/references/`)
- Your personal patterns (in `/assets/`)

→ Claude will prioritize YOUR patterns (with optimization suggestions if needed)

**Exception:** If your patterns actively harm algorithmic reach (external links, engagement bait), Claude will flag this and suggest alignment with platform mechanics while maintaining your authentic voice.

## Getting Started

1. **Week 1:** Fill in PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS in SKILL.md (15 minutes)
2. **Week 2-4:** Add 2-3 voice samples to `/voice-samples/` (20 minutes)
3. **Month 2:** Start populating `/examples/` with your successful posts (ongoing)
4. **Month 3:** Add frameworks and case studies as they develop (ongoing)

The more you populate these folders, the more personalized and valuable this skill becomes. Think of it as a system that learns YOUR patterns over time.
