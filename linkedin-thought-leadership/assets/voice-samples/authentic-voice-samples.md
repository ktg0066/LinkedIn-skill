# Authentic Voice Samples

These samples help Claude understand YOUR natural writing style across different contexts. The more varied samples you provide, the better Claude can match your authentic voice.

## Purpose

When generating LinkedIn content, Claude will:
1. Analyze these samples to understand your natural patterns
2. Match your tone, sentence structure, and vocabulary
3. Incorporate your signature phrases and style preferences
4. Avoid phrases or styles that don't sound like you

## How to Populate This File

Add 2-5 writing samples from different contexts:
- Email to colleagues or clients
- Newsletter excerpt
- Article or blog post
- Presentation script
- Internal report or memo

**Important:** Use your authentic writing, not content you've already optimized for LinkedIn. This helps Claude understand your NATURAL voice before it's been "LinkedIn-ified."

## Instructions for Claude

When generating LinkedIn content for this user:

1. **Start with their natural voice** (from these samples)
2. **Then adapt for LinkedIn** (platform-specific optimizations)
3. **But never sacrifice authenticity** for algorithm optimization

**Priority:** Sound like the user > Optimize for algorithm

**Exception:** If the user's natural style includes algorithmic penalties (external links, engagement bait), flag these issues but maintain their voice in everything else.
