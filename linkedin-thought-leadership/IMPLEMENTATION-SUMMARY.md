## 🎯 Example Transformation

### Before Personalization:
**Prompt:** "Write a post about implementing RAG in organizations"

**Output:** Generic post about RAG benefits, standard structure, sounds like LinkedIn advice blog

### After Personalization (Month 3):
**Prompt:** "Write a post about implementing RAG in organizations"

**Claude's Process:**
1. Checks settings → You're KTG, AI advisor, focus on Norwegian public sector
2. Checks `/examples/` → Your framework posts get 2x engagement vs. theory posts
3. Pulls `/frameworks/` → Your "3-Stage RAG Maturity Model"
4. Uses `/case-studies/` → Your Statens vegvesen implementation
5. Matches `/voice-samples/` → Your "Here's the thing..." style
6. Optimizes for `/audience-insights/` → Your audience is 60% government sector directors

**Output:** Post about YOUR RAG framework, using YOUR case study, in YOUR voice, optimized for YOUR public sector audience, posted at YOUR optimal time (Tuesday 2pm CET). Includes YOUR signature "Here's the thing..." transition, references YOUR actual project results, frames for YOUR director-level audience.
