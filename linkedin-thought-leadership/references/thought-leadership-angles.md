# Thought Leadership Angles

This document provides frameworks for identifying thought leadership angles from any type of content or context.

## Core Principle

Thought leadership isn't about what you know—it's about **how you help others see differently**. Any content can become thought leadership by finding the right angle.

## 8 Universal Angles

### 1. The Contrarian Take
**Pattern:** Challenge conventional wisdom or popular opinion
**Works for:** Research, trends, industry news, best practices
**Structure:** "Everyone thinks X, but here's why Y..."
**Example:** "84% need data overhauls for AI" → "The real problem isn't the data—it's that we're asking the wrong questions"

### 2. The Pattern Recognition
**Pattern:** Connect dots others haven't connected
**Works for:** Multiple data points, trends, personal observations
**Structure:** "I've noticed X in [area 1] and Y in [area 2]—here's the pattern..."
**Example:** Salesforce data + your org's experience → "This explains why our AI pilots succeed but scaling fails"

### 3. The Uncomfortable Truth
**Pattern:** Say what everyone knows but nobody wants to admit
**Works for:** Industry challenges, organizational issues, failed approaches
**Structure:** "Let's talk about what we're not talking about..."
**Example:** "We pretend AI failures are tech problems. They're actually leadership problems."

### 4. The Future Implication
**Pattern:** Extrapolate what current developments mean for the future
**Works for:** New tech, policy changes, market shifts
**Structure:** "If X is true today, then Y will happen tomorrow..."
**Example:** "If 84% need data overhauls now, the winners in 2027 will be..."

### 5. The Personal Lesson
**Pattern:** Share what you learned through experience (especially failures)
**Works for:** Project outcomes, career moments, mistakes made
**Structure:** "I used to believe X. Here's what changed my mind..."
**Example:** "We spent €2M on our data platform. Here's what we should have done instead."

### 6. The Reframe
**Pattern:** Change how people think about a familiar concept
**Works for:** Common terms, standard practices, industry jargon
**Structure:** "We call it X, but it's actually Y..."
**Example:** "We call it 'AI readiness.' I call it 'organizational courage.'"

### 7. The Practical Breakdown
**Pattern:** Make complex topics actionable
**Works for:** Research findings, technical concepts, strategic frameworks
**Structure:** "Here's what [complex thing] actually means for you..."
**Example:** "Salesforce says you need zero-copy architecture. Here's what to do Monday morning."

### 8. The Human Story
**Pattern:** Use narrative to illustrate larger points
**Works for:** Case studies, team experiences, customer interactions
**Structure:** "Let me tell you about [person/situation] and what it teaches us..."
**Example:** "Our AI lead quit last month. Her resignation letter should be required reading."

## Angle Selection Framework

### Step 1: Identify Your Raw Material
What do you have?
- Research/data
- Personal experience
- Industry observation
- Technical knowledge
- Organizational learning
- Customer insight
- Failed attempt
- Success story

### Step 2: Ask The Angle Questions

**For Data/Research:**
- What does this really mean? (Practical Breakdown)
- What are people missing? (Pattern Recognition)
- What's the uncomfortable conclusion? (Uncomfortable Truth)
- How does conventional wisdom fail here? (Contrarian)

**For Personal Experience:**
- What did I learn the hard way? (Personal Lesson)
- What mistake did I make? (Uncomfortable Truth)
- What changed my thinking? (Reframe)
- What will others encounter? (Future Implication)

**For Observations:**
- What pattern am I seeing? (Pattern Recognition)
- What's nobody talking about? (Uncomfortable Truth)
- How should we think about this differently? (Reframe)
- What does this mean for the future? (Future Implication)

### Step 3: Test For Thought Leadership Value

A good angle must pass at least two of these tests:
- **Perspective shift:** Does it make people see things differently?
- **Actionable:** Can someone do something with this insight?
- **Memorable:** Will people remember and share this?
- **Credible:** Is it backed by evidence or genuine experience?
- **Timely:** Is it relevant to current conversations?

## Combining Angles

The most powerful posts often combine 2-3 angles:

**Pattern Recognition + Uncomfortable Truth:**
"I've noticed everyone investing in AI infrastructure (Pattern), but nobody wants to admit it'll take 3 years (Uncomfortable Truth)"

**Personal Lesson + Practical Breakdown:**
"We failed at our first AI project (Personal Lesson). Here's the checklist we now use (Practical Breakdown)"

**Contrarian + Future Implication:**
"Everyone's racing to implement AI (Contrarian: slow down), but in 2 years the winners will be those who built foundations first (Future Implication)"

## Industry-Agnostic Application

These angles work across all industries because they're about **types of thinking**, not specific domains:

- **Tech:** Pattern Recognition + Future Implication
- **Healthcare:** Uncomfortable Truth + Practical Breakdown  
- **Finance:** Contrarian + Personal Lesson
- **Public Sector:** Reframe + Uncomfortable Truth
- **Education:** Personal Lesson + Human Story
- **Consulting:** Pattern Recognition + Practical Breakdown

## Red Flags (Avoid These)

- **Echo chamber:** Repeating what everyone already says
- **Humble brag:** Disguised self-promotion without insight
- **Vague wisdom:** Platitudes without specifics
- **Pure promotion:** Marketing disguised as thought leadership
- **Borrowed authority:** Citing research without adding perspective

## The Thought Leadership Test

Before posting, ask:
1. Does this help someone make a better decision?
2. Does this change how someone thinks about something?
3. Would I find this valuable if someone else wrote it?

If you answer "no" to all three, find a different angle.
