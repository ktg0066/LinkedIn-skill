Fill in your basic information:
```markdown
**Name:** [Your full name]
**Current Role:** [Job title]
**Organization:** [Company name]
**Industry/Domain:** [Primary industry]

**Core Expertise Areas (3-5 topics):**
1. [Your topic 1]

3. [Your topic 3]

**Target Audience:**
- Primary: [Who you're trying to reach]
- Geographic focus: [Region or global]

**Voice Preferences:**

- Preferred post length: [Short/Medium/Long]
```

**That's it for Week 1!** Claude now generates content tailored to YOUR context.

Navigate to `/assets/voice-samples/authentic-voice-samples.md`

Add 2-3 samples of YOUR natural writing:
- An email to a colleague

This teaches Claude to match YOUR authentic voice, not generic LinkedIn voice.

### Step 3: Track Your Successes (Month 2+)

After each successful post:
1. Go to `/assets/examples/high-engagement-posts.md`
2. Copy the post text and note metrics
3. Analyze why it worked

Claude learns YOUR patterns and applies them to future content.

### Step 4: Build Your Asset Library (Ongoing)

As you develop content and insights:
- Add frameworks to `/assets/frameworks/`
- Document case studies in `/assets/case-studies/`
- Track audience insights in `/assets/audience-insights/`
